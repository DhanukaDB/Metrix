                            Metric products is a 70 years plus family owned business. We have been making bra and swim cups for a long
                            time and have perfected the technique of giving softness to products while being able to hold shapes of almost
                            any design. To accomplish this and become a leading swimwear and bra cup supplier around the world, we have
                            developed and perfected a product we call Metric 66.

                            <li className="mb-4"> Metric 66 is often mistaken for Neoprene which it is not. Neoprene cannot be molded and is not breathable. It is also extremely heavy.</li>
                            <li className="mb-4">On the other hand, metric 66 is breathable, light weighted, hand washable and is very quick to dry.</li>
                            <li className="mb-4"> It is versatile and can be created in a variety of stiffness' and softnes'.</li>
                            <li className="mb-4"> Metric 66 is Oeko Tex certified, which is a European certification which ensures the contents and make of a product are safe to be next to the most intimate parts of the body.</li>
                            <li>Ideally suited to create all sorts of three dimensional objects, metric 66 can be created in any color imaginable.</li>
